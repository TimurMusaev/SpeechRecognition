# SpeechRecognition
 
 This soft uses your local mic to transfer speech to text. It uses Vosk library for recognition. Also, utilizes multithreading to record live.  
 It does have a 20 second delay, but its mostly there because I wanted to include punctuation.  
 I used it for notetaking for online lectures.  
 
 Further improvements:  
 Add a huggingface transformers to summarize what is being said.  
 Play around with the punctuation module to decrease the delay.
